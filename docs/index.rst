   :alt: Mail App Built with Kivy Cupertino


Kivy Cupertino is a collection of iOS style widgets following `Apple's Human Interface <https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/>`_
guidelines. It is created to use for `Kivy's <https://kivy.org/#home>`_ cross platform framework.
The projectâ€™s goal is to approximate Apple's Human Interface spec as close as possible without sacrificing ease of use or application performance.

.. warning:: We are currently in **beta** status;
    not all widgets have been implemented and stability is not guaranteed.
    We don't recommend using Kivy Cupertino in production.
